# Digital-Simulated-Turntable
For those of you in the know this project has the main goal of creating a simulation table for phyisics based things starting with electrical outputs.
Some things to look for:
- Inital Python mock up and rough framing
- Switch to C or other to be determined language for speed and compuwtational efficency
- Expansion of the main goal out to other advanced physics sujects for more simulation tables
