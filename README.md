# Digital-Simulated-Turntable
For this prodject we are hoping to simulate a turn table and output the respoces into diffrent types of playable meida. Some things to look for are:
- MP3 Outputs
- Live audio prossesing
- Efficent decoding algorithims
- data Data DATAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
# Mock up will most likely be in Python and then switch to a more efficent language (TannerSchultz06 is thinking C or C++)
